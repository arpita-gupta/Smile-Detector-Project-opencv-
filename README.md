# Smile-Detector-Project-opencv-
In this repository I will commit a project which detects face and smile using OpenCV
Author Name- Arpita Gupta
Project Name-  Smile Detector

Description-  It is based on the detection of face,facial features such as eyes and smile.It is build uding the libriaries of OpenCV in python.


About the project-
OpenCV
OpenCV is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. It is a BSD-licence product thus free for both business and academic purposes.The Library provides more than 2500 algorithms that include machine learning tools for classification and clustering, image processing and vision algorithm, basic algorithms and drawing functions, GUI and I/O functions for images and videos. Some applications of these algorithms include face detection, object recognition, extracting 3D models, image processing, camera calibration, motion analysis etc.

OpenCV is written natively in C/C++. It has C++, C, Python and Java interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS, and Android. OpenCV was designed for computational efficiency and targeted for real-time applications. Written in optimized C/C++, the library can take advantage of multi-core processing.

Face Detection
Face detection has gained a lot of attention due to its real-time applications. A lot of research has been done and still going on for improved and fast implementation of the face detection algorithm. Why is face detection difficult for a machine? Face detection is not as easy as it seems due to lots of variations of image appearance, such as pose variation (front, non-front), occlusion, image orientation, illumination changes and facial expression.

Haar Cascade Classifier
It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive (images with face) and negative images (images without face). The algorithm is proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones.

Installation-
For running this project locally on your computer you need following things-
1.Python Idle (Various versions are available.I used 3.7.0)
2.OpenCv installed on your device
For installing OpenCv on window Refer the following link
https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_setup/py_setup_in_windows/py_setup_in_windows.html
For installing OpenCv on Linux refer the following link
https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html
3.HaarCascade Files (in XML) which is attached below.
